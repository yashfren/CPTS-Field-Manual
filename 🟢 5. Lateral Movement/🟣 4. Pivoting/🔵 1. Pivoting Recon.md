#### On Unix/Linux (like Kali):

```bash
ifconfig
```    

Shows network interfaces, assigned IPs, MACs, and interface state.      
Useful flags:     
1. ifconfig -a → show all interfaces (even down ones).      
2. ifconfig </iface/> down/up → bring interface down/up.

```bash
ip a or ip addr
```

1.  Modern replacement for ifconfig.     
2. Shows IPs, MACs, and interface states in more detail.

```bash        
 netstat -r
``` 

Shows the routing table (same as route -n).

Flags:       
1. -r → routing table.         
2. -tuln → list TCP/UDP listeners with no DNS resolution.

```bash
 ip route
```
 
 Also shows the routing table like netstat -r.

```bash       
route -n
``` 
Older tool, directly shows routing table without DNS lookup.

```bash
 ss -tuln
```

 Modern replacement for netstat -tuln. Shows open/listening ports.
#### On Windows:

```bash
ipconfig
```

Shows IPv4/IPv6, subnet mask, default gateway per interface.   
Flags:
1. /all → show MAC, DNS, DHCP info.

```bash
route print
```

Shows the routing table, similar to netstat -r.

```bash
netstat -r
```

Also shows the routing table, but route print is more detailed.

```bash
netstat -an
```

Shows active connections and listening ports with raw IPs/ports.

Other useful flags:

1. -a → all connections and listeners        
2. -n → no DNS resolution
3. -o → include PID for each connection

```powershell-session
Get-NetIPAddress
```

Shows IPs assigned to each interface.

```Powershell-session
Get-NetRoute
```    

Lists routing table entries.
