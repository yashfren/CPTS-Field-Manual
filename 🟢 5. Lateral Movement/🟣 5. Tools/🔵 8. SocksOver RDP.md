[SocksOverRDP](https://github.com/nccgroup/SocksOverRDP) allows tunneling of arbitrary data over RDP using Dynamic Virtual Channels (DVC), a Windows feature typically used for clipboard or audio sharing. It's useful in Windows-only environments where SSH isn't available. Combined with Proxifier, it enables SOCKS5 proxy tunneling over an active RDP session.

We will use the tool [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) as our proxy server.

We can start by downloading the appropriate binaries to our attack host to perform this attack. Having the binaries on our attack host will allow us to transfer them to each target where needed. We will need:

1. [SocksOverRDP x64 Binaries](https://github.com/nccgroup/SocksOverRDP/releases)
2. [Proxifier Portable Binary](https://www.proxifier.com/download/#win-tab)

- We can look for `ProxifierPE.zip`

We can then connect to the target using xfreerdp and copy the `SocksOverRDPx64.zip` file to the target. From the Windows target, we will then need to load the SocksOverRDP.dll using regsvr32.exe.
#### Loading SocksOverRDP.dll using regsvr32.exe

```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\SocksOverRDP-x64> regsvr32.exe SocksOverRDP-Plugin.dll
```

Now we can connect to 172.16.5.19 over RDP using `mstsc.exe`, and we should receive a prompt that the SocksOverRDP plugin is enabled, and it will listen on 127.0.0.1:1080. We can use the credentials `victor:pass@123` to connect to 172.16.5.19.

We will need to transfer SocksOverRDPx64.zip or just the SocksOverRDP-Server.exe to 172.16.5.19. We can then start SocksOverRDP-Server.exe with Admin privileges.

When we go back to our foothold target and check with Netstat, we should see our SOCKS listener started on 127.0.0.1:1080.

#### Confirming the SOCKS Listener is Started

```cmd-session
C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\SocksOverRDP-x64> netstat -antb | findstr 1080

  TCP    127.0.0.1:1080         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
```

After starting our listener, we can transfer Proxifier portable to the Windows 10 target (on the 10.129.x.x network), and configure it to forward all our packets to 127.0.0.1:1080. Proxifier will route traffic through the given host and port. See the clip below for a quick walkthrough of configuring Proxifier.

#### Configuring Proxifier

![[Pasted image 20250602025451.png]]

With Proxifier configured and running, we can start mstsc.exe, and it will use Proxifier to pivot all our traffic via 127.0.0.1:1080, which will tunnel it over RDP to 172.16.5.19, which will then route it to 172.16.6.155 using SocksOverRDP-server.exe.

#### RDP Performance Considerations

When interacting with our RDP sessions on an engagement, we may find ourselves contending with slow performance in a given session, especially if we are managing multiple RDP sessions simultaneously. If this is the case, we can access the `Experience` tab in mstsc.exe and set `Performance` to `Modem`.

Note: When spawning your target, we ask you to wait for 3 - 5 minutes until the whole lab with all the configurations is set up so that the connection to your target works flawlessly.
