# What is tcpdump?
### tcpdump is a command-line packet capture tool used to monitor, capture, and analyze network traffic in real-time.

# Stuff we can do:

| Use Case                                                     | Example                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Sniff traffic on a specific interface                        | `sudo tcpdump -i eth0`                  |
| Filter by source IP (from IP)                                | `sudo tcpdump src host 10.129.2.28`     |
| Filter by destination IP (to IP)                             | `sudo tcpdump dst host 10.129.2.28`     |
| Filter by source port (from port)                            | `sudo tcpdump src port 80`              |
| Filter by destination port (to port)                         | `sudo tcpdump dst port 80`              |
| Show only TCP traffic                                        | `sudo tcpdump tcp`                      |
| Save to file (for Wireshark)                                 | `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap`  |
| Read from file                                               | `sudo tcpdump -r capture.pcap`          |
| View full packet content (not truncated)                     | `sudo tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514`            |
| View traffic between 2 IP addresses, on a specific interface | `sudo tcpdump host IP1 and IP2 -i tun0` |
| Show only DNS queries (UDP 53)                               | `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 53`          |
# Knowledge base

|Flag|Meaning|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|`[S]`|SYN|First step in 3-way handshake — client is trying to start a connection.|
|`[S.]`|SYN-ACK|Server acknowledges the SYN — ready to establish a connection.|
|`[.]`|ACK|Acknowledgment — part of handshake or ongoing data transfer.|
|`[R]`|RST|Reset — connection refused or forcefully closed.|
|`[P.]`|PSH-ACK|Push + ACK — sending data immediately (e.g., HTTP request, SMTP banner).|
|`[F.]`|FIN-ACK|Graceful close — one side is finishing the connection.|
