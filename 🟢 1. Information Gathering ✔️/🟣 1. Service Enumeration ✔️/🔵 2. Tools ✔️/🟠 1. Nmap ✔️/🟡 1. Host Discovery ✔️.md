| `sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24`         | Scan IP subnet                                                     |
| `sudo nmap -iL hosts.lst`         | Scan hosts from list of IPs (txt file)                             |
| `sudo nmap -sn IP1 IP2 ...`       | Scan multiple IP addresses                                         |
| `sudo nmap -sn IP`                | -sn flag disables port scanning, only detects if host is up or not |
| `sudo nmap -sn 10.10.2.1-9`       | Scan IP range                                                      |
| `sudo nmap IP -PE`                | Ensure ICMP echo packets are sent                                  |
| `sudo nmap IP --packet-trace`     | Shows all packets sent and received                                |
| `sudo nmap IP --traceroute`       | Shows the path that takes to reach the target                      |
| `sudo nmap IP --reason`           | Show reason for a specific result                                  |
| `sudo nmap IP --disable-arp-ping` | Well, disable's arp pings                                          |
# Overview

Not much to do here we are just trying to determine what hosts are up. In case hosts are shown as down just check if VPN is still connected. If it is check if our tunnel is up if we are working on an internal network or with proxychains. 
# Knowledge base

## ICMP echo requests (Internet Control Message Protocol):

We send these packets (type 8) to host. Host replies with a response packet (type 0). However may be blocked in order to make enumeration harder. Note that these operate at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model. -PE flag to make sure these requests are sent. -Pn will not send any requests and assume that the host is up.
## ARP pings (Address Resolution Protocol):

Kind of same as ICMP echo requests but these are sent when host is on the same network as us and works on a lower level as compared to ICMP echo requests. Target replies with its MAC address with an ARP reply --disable-arp-ping flag makes sures that only ICMP echo requests are sent. It works on Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.
