# Overview

> NSE scripts live in `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/`  
> List all scripts: `ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/`  
> Search by keyword: `locate *ftp* | grep .nse`


Types of scripts that NSE provides, put in category:

| **Category** | **Description**                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth`       | Determination of authentication credentials.                                                                                            |
| `broadcast`  | Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans. |
| `brute`      | Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.                                        |
| `default`    | Default scripts executed by using the `-sC` option.                                                                                     |
| `discovery`  | Evaluation of accessible services.                                                                                                      |
| `dos`        | These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.              |
| `exploit`    | This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.                                                   |
| `external`   | Scripts that use external services for further processing.                                                                              |
| `fuzzer`     | This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.     |
| `intrusive`  | Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.                                                                       |
| `malware`    | Checks if some malware infects the target system.                                                                                       |
| `safe`       | Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.                                                                 |
| `version`    | Extension for service detection.                                                                                                        |
| `vuln`       | Identification of specific vulnerabilities.                                                                                             |
# Knowledge base

### `--initial-rtt-timeout 50ms`

This sets the initial **Round-Trip Time (RTT) timeout** to 50 milliseconds. Nmap will wait 50ms for a response before deciding whether to retry or consider the host unresponsive. Useful in **fast, low-latency networks** to avoid wasting time.
### `--max-rtt-timeout 100ms`

This defines the **maximum amount of time** Nmap will wait for any response — even with retries. It caps the wait time at 100ms per probe, speeding up scans by avoiding long delays from slow or unresponsive hosts.
### `--max-retries 0`

Prevents Nmap from retrying failed probes. This can significantly **speed up scans**, especially in time-limited environments like **CTFs**, but may cause some missed results on unstable networks.
### `--min-rate 300`

Tells Nmap to send **at least 300 packets per second**, increasing scan speed. Useful for **aggressive scanning** in controlled environments where speed is more important than stealth.
### `--max-rate 1000`

Sets an upper limit: Nmap won’t send more than **1000 packets per second**, preventing it from overwhelming the network or getting rate-limited. Handy when balancing speed with stability or avoiding IDS alerts.
