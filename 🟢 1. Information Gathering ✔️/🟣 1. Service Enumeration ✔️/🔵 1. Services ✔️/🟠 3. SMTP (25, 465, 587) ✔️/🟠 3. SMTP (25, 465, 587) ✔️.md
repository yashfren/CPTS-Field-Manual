# Why am I here
### SMTP is Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. Its unencrypted on port 25 and encrypted on port 587. It may also use port 465 (Implicit TLS) for encrypted communication (Start TLS).
# Knowledge Base:
## VRFY command can be used for finding if a user is valid or not. When we can't verify a user's presence we get  a response code 252. 250 means a success and 550 means user not verified.
## A better way to do this is to use `smtp-user-enum` 
## Usage - `smtp-user-enum  -M VRFY -U smtpusersfootprinting -t 10.129.221.223 -w 15 -D inlanefreight.htb`
## There is also a metasploit module for smtp-user-enum, which is better than the cli tool
