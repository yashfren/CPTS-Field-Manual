# Why am I here?
### Because I found a open ports and some services. Let's see what we have and try to find a way in.

# What I got?
### [[🟠 1. FTP (21) ✔️]] - File Transfer Protocol (Found it running on port 2121 a couple times)
### [[🟠 2. SSH (22)✔️]] - Secure Shell (Found it running on port 2222 a few times)
### [[🟠 3. SMTP (25, 465, 587) ✔️]] - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
### [[🟢 1. Information Gathering ✔️/🟣 1. Service Enumeration ✔️/🔵 1. Services ✔️/🟠 4. DNS (53)✔️/🟠 4. DNS (53)✔️]] - Domain Name System. Be sure to check for DNS zone transfers etc. 
### [[🟠 5. TFTP (69) ✔️]] - Trivial FTP, less secure than FTP
### [[🟠 6. Kerberos (88)]] - If you got this, its probably a Domain controller or a domain joined host
### [[🟠 7. POP3 (110,995) ✔️]] - Post Office Protocol version 3 basically used for emails
### [[🟠 8. IMAP (143, 993) ✔️]] - Internet Message Access Protocol basically used for emails
### [[🟠 9. SMB (139, 445) ✔️]] - Server Message Block. Typically a windows port. If open and you got creds of a user with admin privs, you can use psexec from impacket to escalate privileges (That time on Zephyr prolab lol)
### [[🟠 10. SNMP (161, 162, 10161, 10162)✔️]] - Simple Network Management Protocol - Managing the network basically. SNMP strings may have info
### [[🟠 11. R-Services (512, 513, 514)✔️]] - Berkeley r-commands. Used for same stuff as SSH.  https://infra.newerasec.com/infrastructure-testing/enumeration/services-ports/rservices
### [[🟠 12. IPMI (623)✔️]] - Intelligent Platform Management Interface
### [[🟠 13. Rsync (873)✔️]] - transfer and sync files between computers
### [[🟠 14. MSSQL (1433, 1434, 2433)✔️]] - Microsoft SQL Server, has creds. We can also enable xp_cmdshell to get a reverse shell via RCE
### [[🟠 15. Oracle TNS (1521)✔️]] - Transparent Network Substrate, used for communicating with db server
### [[🟠 16. NFS (2049)✔️]] - Network File System, mount somewhere on attacker machine. If open, may have credentials
### [[🟠 17. MySQL (3306)✔️]] - SQL server. Has creds mostly
### [[🟠 18. RDP (3389)✔️]] - Remote Desktop Protocol, helps have a GUI interface on windows. We can use /share on xfreerdp for quick file transfers between host and victim
### [[🟠 19. WinRM (5985, 5986)✔️]] - Windows Remote Management, 5985 is unencrypted and 5986 is. Can evil-winrm if we got creds or NTLM hashes
