# Knowledge Base
### DNS config files in Unix based systers are named.conf, subdivided into named.conf.local named.conf.options, named.conf.log, stored in /etc/bind/. Refer to [[游리 1. Record Types九덢잺]] for information on what we can get by querying DNS. The맏osts맍ile is located inC:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts맖n Windows and in/etc/hosts맖n Linux and MacOS.
### DNS Zones are basically servers that have a list of all DNS entries for a domain. This includes its subdomains.  
### DNS Zone transfers are how we get these subdomains by requesting copies of records from DNS servers when allow-transfer from [[游릭 1. Information Gathering 九덢잺/游릮 1. Service Enumeration 九덢잺/游댯 1. Services 九덢잺/游 4. DNS (53)九덢잺/游리 2. Dangerous Settings九덢잺|游리 2. Dangerous Settings九덢잺]] is enabled. Refer to it for further information.
### We can do zone transfers on subdomains we get to get sub-subdomains, like when we get dev.inlanefreight.htb, we may get DC01.dev.inlanefreight.htb by doing `dig axfr dev.inlanefreight.htb`, just remember to add all subdomains from the first zone transfer to /etc/hosts. Zone transfers use TCP port and not UDP.
