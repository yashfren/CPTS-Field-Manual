# Knowledge base

This is how NFS is configured. These hosts are added to /etc/exports which is an Access Control list.

```bash
root@nfs:~/ echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
root@nfs:~/ systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server 
root@nfs:~/ exportfs

/mnt/nfs      	10.129.14.0/24
```
