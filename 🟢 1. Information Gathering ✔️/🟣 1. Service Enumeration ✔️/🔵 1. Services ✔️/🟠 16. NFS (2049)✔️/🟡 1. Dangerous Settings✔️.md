| `nohide`         | If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry. |

### `rw`

This allows clients to both read from and write to the shared NFS directory. If attackers get access, they could modify or upload files - including malicious scripts or binaries.
### `insecure`

Normally, NFS only accepts requests from privileged ports (below 1024). This setting allows access from unprivileged ports (above 1024), making it easier for attackers to spoof trusted clients.
### `nohide`

If there's a separate filesystem mounted inside a shared NFS directory, this setting exposes that hidden mount as part of the export too. It might unintentionally leak more directories than intended.
### `no_root_squash`

By default, remote root users are mapped to an unprivileged user (like `nobody`). This disables that protection, allowing remote root users to act as real root on the NFS share â€” extremely dangerous.
