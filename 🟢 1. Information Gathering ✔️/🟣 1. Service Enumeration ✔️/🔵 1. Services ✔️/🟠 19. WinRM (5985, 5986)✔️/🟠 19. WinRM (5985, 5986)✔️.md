## WinRM stands for Windows Remote Management.

## Footprinting the service:

```bash
nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p5985,5986 --disable-arp-ping -n
```
### If we want to find out whether one or more remote servers can be reached via WinRM, we can easily do this with the help of PowerShell. The [Test-WsMan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.wsman.management/test-wsman?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet is responsible for this, and the host's name in question is passed to it. In Linux-based environments, we can use the tool called [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm), another penetration testing tool designed to interact with WinRM.
## Getting a winrm shell

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.248 -u Cry0l1t3 -p P455w0rD!
```
