# Why am I here?
## Because I found the TFTP service on some port maybe port 69 which is most likely. Presence of this service indicates that I might be on a local/protected network as TFTP isn't secure like FTP.
# TF is TFTP?
## Stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol. Its similar to FTP but doesn't have authentication mechanism and directory listing capabilities. Also, it runs on UDP unlike FTP which runs on TCP.
