## IPMI is a remote management tool built into server hardware that gives administrators control and monitoring capabilities outside of the regular operating system, ensuring that they can manage systems at a very low level, even during hardware failures.
## Refer to [[🟡 1.  Authentication✔️]] to check out how we use metasploit for dumping IPMI hashes.
## Refer to [[🟡 2. Default Credentials✔️]] that I got using [[🟠 4. creds ✔️]]

## Footprinting the service 

```bash
sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 <Target IP>
```
