# Overview

In the context of SMB, _spidering_ refers to exploring shared directories recursively to uncover sensitive files, scripts, backups, credentials, or misconfigurations. Like spidering a website, this is about digging through folders and file names — only here, it’s over the SMB protocol using manual or automated tools.

| Tool / Command                                         | What It Does                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `smbclient //IP/share -N`                              | Connect to a share (anonymous/null session)                                          |
| `ls`, `cd`, `get`, `mget`, `prompt`, `recurse`         | Commands inside smbclient for browsing and pulling files                             |
| `recurse`                                              | Enables recursive listing inside `smbclient`                                         |
| `prompt`                                               | Disables interactive "yes/no" when downloading many files with `mget`                |
| `smbmap -H <IP> --depth 5`                             | Recursively spider shares up to 5 levels deep                                        |
| `smbmap -H <IP> -R`                                    | Lists all files recursively in readable shares                                       |
| `crackmapexec smb <IP> --shares`                       | Lists shares and checks for read/write access                                        |
| `enum4linux-ng <IP> -A`                                | Attempts to enumerate all shares, files, OS info, user accounts, etc.                |
| `findstr /s /i password *.txt` (in smb-mounted folder) | Windows-style grep — used if you mount share locally and want to search for keywords |
| `grep -r 'password\|secret\|key' /mnt/smb`             | Search through mounted share locally on Linux for sensitive strings                  |
# Knowledge Base

- Recurse in smbclient: Use `recurse` followed by `ls` or `mget *` to crawl through subfolders automatically.
- Mget + Prompt: Disable prompt with `prompt` to download many files at once using `mget`.
- Common juicy files: Look for `*.bak`, `*.zip`, `*.ps1`, `*.env`, `*.txt`, `*.docx`, `*.xls`, `passwords.csv`.
- Permission Enumeration: Tools like `smbmap` show whether shares are READ, WRITE, or NO ACCESS.
- Mount SMB share: On Linux, you can mount a share using `mount -t cifs`, then spider it like a local filesystem with `find`, `grep`, or `fd`.
