# Why am I here?
#### To figure out wtf is running on the machine and whether I can kick the door down.
# What are services?
#### Services are the protocols/apps running on given target. We try to exploit common misconfigurations to gain a foothold, escalate privileges or move laterally (finding credentials etc) or identify and exploit outdated versions.

# How do I go from here?
# [[🔵 1. Services ✔️]] 
### Break down commonly exposed services like FTP, SMB, MySQL, RDP. Look for version issues, misconfigs, default creds, anonymous access, etc.

# [[🔵 2. Tools ✔️]]

## Pick the right tool for the job. Nmap, enum4linux, snmpwalk, etc.
