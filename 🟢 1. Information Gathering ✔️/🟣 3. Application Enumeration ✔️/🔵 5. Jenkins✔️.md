## Jenkins – Discovery & Enumeration
### Overview

- Type: Open-source automation server for continuous integration (CI/CD)    
- Language: Java    
- Container: Typically deployed in Tomcat    
- Default Ports:
    - `8080` – Web UI (Tomcat)
    - `5000` – Communication between master and slave nodes        
- Notable Facts:
    - Originally released as Hudson (2005); renamed to Jenkins in 2011    
    - Used by over 86,000 companies
    - Popular with companies like Facebook, Netflix, LinkedIn, Udemy, Robinhood        
    - Supports 300+ plugins for build/test automation
    - Often runs as SYSTEM on Windows (high-privileged access)
### Why Target Jenkins?

- Frequently misconfigured or exposed in internal environments    
- May lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Privileged foothold if running as SYSTEM
- May allow domain enumeration or privilege escalation in AD environments
### Discovery / Fingerprinting
#### Step 1: Port Scanning

- Look for open 8080 (Tomcat) and 5000 (slave comm) ports during internal scans    
#### Step 2: Access Login Page

- Jenkins login page is easily fingerprinted:

```
http://<target>:8080/login
```

- Classic login URL example:    

```
http://jenkins.inlanefreight.local:8000/login?from=%2F
```
#### Step 3: Access Security Configuration (if exposed)

```
http://jenkins.inlanefreight.local:8000/configureSecurity/
```
#### Page Behavior

- If accessible without login → unauthenticated access
- If login appears → try default credentials like:
    - `admin:admin`        
    - `admin:password`
### Authentication Backends Supported

| Method                         | Description                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Jenkins' own user database     | Stores local users (default)                         |
| LDAP                           | Tied to Active Directory or other directory services |
| Unix user database             | Uses system users on Linux                           |
| Delegated to servlet container | Auth controlled by external servlet like Tomcat      |
| No authentication              | Fully open; unauthenticated                          |
### Key Observations

- Default Configuration:    
    - Uses internal user database
    - Does not allow self-registration
    - Sometimes weak or no credentials configured
- Risk:
    - If running as SYSTEM (on Windows), access may yield full control over the host
    - Exploitable for lateral movement or domain enumeration if in AD environment
### Summary – Jenkins Enumeration Strategy

| Phase               | Actions                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discovery           | Scan for ports `8080` and `5000`                                 |
| Fingerprinting      | Access `/login` and `/configureSecurity`                         |
| Credential Stuffing | Try weak/default creds (`admin:admin`, etc.)                     |
| Auth Check          | Confirm whether auth is enforced or not                          |
| Report              | Record instance version, authentication status, and access level |
