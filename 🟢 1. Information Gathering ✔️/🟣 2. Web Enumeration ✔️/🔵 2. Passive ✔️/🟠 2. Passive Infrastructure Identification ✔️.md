### Domain.glass https://domain.glass/ 

Domain.glass is a passive reconnaissance tool used to gather publicly available data about a domain. It acts like a centralized dashboard, pulling in information from various open sources. When you input a domain name, Domain.glass can show you DNS records, IP addresses, SSL certificate details (including issuer, subject, and subject alternative names), and sometimes even connected social media profiles or other public assets. One particularly useful feature is that it reveals whether a domain is protected by Cloudflare or other security layers, giving you early insight into potential filtering or protection mechanisms.
### GrayHatWarfare https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/

GrayHatWarfare is a search engine designed to index publicly exposed cloud storage buckets, primarily from AWS S3, Azure Blobs, and Google Cloud Storage. It allows you to search for open buckets by keyword - commonly the company name or its abbreviation - and then explore the contents of those buckets (if accessible). The interface also supports filtering by file type, so you can narrow down your search to `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.env`, `.key`, and other potentially sensitive file formats.

This platform is particularly valuable for uncovering misconfigured cloud storage, one of the most common real-world vulnerabilities. Many organizations accidentally expose their storage buckets either for convenience or due to misconfiguration. As a result, tools like GrayHatWarfare can help identify sensitive files like internal documentation, source code, SSH private keys, API keys, and more, all without triggering alerts or touching the target directly.
