# Legacy Operating Systems

Privilege escalation is often easier on legacy systems due to the absence of modern security controls, lack of vendor support, and exposure to unpatched vulnerabilities. Despite the focus on Windows 10 and Server 2016/2019 in most engagements, it is **common to encounter older systems**—especially in large, resource-constrained organizations.
## End of Life (EOL) Systems

Microsoft discontinues support for older operating systems, ending regular security updates and bug fixes. This puts unsupported systems at high risk of exploitation.

## Impact of Legacy Systems

| Issue                        | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Security Patches**      | Remote Code Execution (RCE) and LPE flaws remain unpatched forever.   |
| **Software Incompatibility** | Browsers, agents, and enterprise tools may stop supporting legacy OS. |
| **Driver/Hardware Gaps**     | Newer peripherals won’t work.                                         |
| **Application Lock-In**      | Old OS versions may be required to run mission-critical legacy apps.  |
These systems are often found in hospitals, universities, and local/state government where upgrading is cost-prohibitive or where legacy vendor software is no longer supported.
## Why This Matters in Pentesting

- **Exploitable services and binaries**: Legacy systems often still run SMBv1, RDP with weak auth, or IIS 6.0.
- **Known CVEs**: Think MS08-067, EternalBlue, BlueKeep, etc
- **Weaker default configurations**: UAC, AppLocker, Windows Defender, etc. were less restrictive or non-existent.
- **Less logging**: Audit policies are usually misconfigured or completely absent.
- **No mitigation features**: ASLR, DEP, and Credential Guard are either off or unavailable.
## Handling Fragile Systems

Before exploitation:

- **Ask the client** if the system runs critical infrastructure.    
- **Never crash** or reboot legacy systems during live tests.
- If exploitation is too risky, **suggest isolation via VLANs or access controls** instead of removal.
## Practical Advice

> These systems are low-hanging fruit and often your entry point. Just make sure you’re not breaking production.

Even though MS08-067 is less common, Windows Server 2003 and 2008 still show up in real-world networks and are often vulnerable to well-documented exploits. Use caution but take advantage of the lack of protections for privilege escalation where appropriate.
