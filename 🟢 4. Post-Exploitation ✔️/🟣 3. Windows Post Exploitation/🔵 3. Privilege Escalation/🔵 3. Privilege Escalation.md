### Technique Name:
Initial Enumeration (Windows)
### Summary:
This technique focuses on gathering all possible details about the target Windows system after obtaining initial shell access. The goal is to identify OS version, running services, installed software, privilege levels, active users, password policies, and potential misconfigurations. This enumeration helps identify viable privilege escalation vectors and ensures the attacker adapts to system-specific defenses or restrictions.

### Conditions:
- Access to a standard user shell (CMD or PowerShell)
- Commands must not be blocked by AppLocker or EDR
- No reliance on external tooling (manual enumeration approach)
### Enumeration:
```powershell
# System Information
systeminfo

# List installed hotfixes
wmic qfe
Get-HotFix

# Show installed software
wmic product get name
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Product | select Name, Version

# Show running processes and services
tasklist /svc

# Show network connections and listening ports
netstat -ano

# Display environment variables (PATH, HOMEDRIVE, etc.)
set

# List all users
net user

# Show logged-in users
query user

# Show current user and privileges
echo %USERNAME%
whoami
whoami /priv
whoami /groups

# List local groups
net localgroup

# View members of Administrators group
net localgroup administrators

# Show system password policy
net accounts
```

### Exploitation:
```powershell
# Not a direct exploit technique, but enables:
# 1. Discovery of vulnerable software (e.g., FileZilla, outdated Java)
# 2. Identification of misconfigured services running as SYSTEM
# 3. Finding reused user credentials or shared folders
# 4. Mapping dual-homed systems or services bound to localhost
# 5. Locating writable paths in PATH variable for DLL hijacking
# 6. Recognizing users/groups that allow privilege escalation
```

### Post-Exploitation:
* Use results to select appropriate privesc technique (e.g., SeImpersonatePrivilege if present)
* Look for lateral movement paths (e.g., other RDP sessions or shared home directories)
* Search installed software for credential stores or insecure configurations
* Identify weak password policies or reused admin accounts
* Map out patch levels and match with known kernel or service exploits
