# User and Computer Description Field Abuse

The **`description` field** in Active Directory (AD) user or computer objects can often contain **plaintext passwords, internal notes, or credentials** left there by sysadmins or developers during automation, scripting, or user provisioning.

This field can be abused both **locally** (on the box) and **remotely** (via LDAP enumeration or tools like BloodHound).
## 1. Why This Works

- Description fields are **not protected by default ACLs**.    
- They are **readable by any authenticated user** in the domain.
- Admins frequently store useful context here (e.g., user role, system info), and sometimes credentials for ease.
## 2. Enumerating User Description Field
### Using PowerView (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-NetUser | Select-Object cn,description
```
### Using `net user` locally:

```bash
net user <username> /domain
```

Look at the `Description` field in the output.
## 3. Enumerating Computer Description Field
### Using PowerView:

```powershell
Get-NetComputer | Select-Object cn,description
```

Useful if admins leave computer-to-user mappings or service context here.
## 4. Real-World Use Case

```powershell
Get-NetUser | Where-Object {$_.description -like "*pass*" -or $_.description -like "*admin*"} | 
Select-Object cn,description
```

Often reveals:

- `tempadmin / pass1234`    
- `SQLBox Service Account / sqlsvc / Summer2021`
- `Helpdesk account / reset every month / !H3lpd3sk!`
## 5. Example Output

```bash
cn                description
--                -----------
svc_sqladmin      SQL DB Service Account - P@ssw0rd123!
tempadmin         Temp access for intern, password: Intern1!
```

You can try using these credentials for **lateral movement, privilege escalation,** or **pivoting via RDP, SMB, or WinRM**.
## 6. Tips

- When paired with **BloodHound**, these fields often surface in `UserProperties` or `ComputerProperties`.    
- Always grep exported data (e.g., from `ldapdomaindump`) for `description`.
- Consider crafting your own LDAP queries when tools like PowerView are blocked.
## 7. Enumerating Description Fields

**For local users:**

```powershell
Get-LocalUser
```

Check the `Description` field â€” sometimes passwords or internal notes are stored here.

**For computer object:**

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | select Description
```
