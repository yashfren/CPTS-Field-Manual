### Scheduled Task Enumeration

**Via schtasks:**

```cmd
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```

**Via PowerShell:**

```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask | select TaskName, State
```

You can only list tasks you own or those with readable ACLs.

### Privilege Escalation via Writable Scripts

If administrators misconfigure scheduled tasks to execute scripts from folders like `C:\Scripts`, and those folders are writable, you can modify the script and wait for it to run:

```cmd
accesschk64.exe /accepteula -s -d C:\Scripts\
```

If `BUILTIN\Users` has **RW** permissions and the script is executed by SYSTEM, appending a reverse shell to that script can yield SYSTEM access.
