# Built-in Active Directory Groups

Windows Active Directory (AD) includes **built-in security groups** with predefined privileges. Understanding these groups is essential for identifying **privileged users**, **lateral movement opportunities**, and **escalation paths** during post-exploitation.
## 1. Common Built-in Groups

|Group Name|RID|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Domain Admins**|512|Full control over the domain. Most powerful AD group.|
|**Enterprise Admins**|519|Full control over all domains in the forest.|
|**Schema Admins**|518|Permission to modify the AD schema. Dangerous, rarely needed.|
|**Administrators**|544|Local admin access on domain controllers.|
|**Account Operators**|548|Can create, modify, and delete user accounts (excluding admins).|
|**Backup Operators**|551|Can bypass file system permissions to back up or restore files.|
|**Print Operators**|550|Can manage printers. Can also log on locally to DCs by default.|
|**Server Operators**|549|Can log on to domain controllers and manage servers.|
|**DnsAdmins**|custom|Can manage DNS. Often misconfigured and abusable.|
|**Remote Desktop Users**|555|Can log on using RDP if otherwise permitted.|
## 2. Enumeration Techniques

### PowerShell

```powershell
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins"
```

```powershell
Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select Name
```
### net command

```cmd
net group "Domain Admins" /domain
```
## 3. Attack Opportunities

| Group                 | Abuse Potential                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain Admins**     | Full access. Dump secrets, modify DCs, create persistence. |
| **Enterprise Admins** | Cross-domain privilege escalation (forest-wide).           |
| **DnsAdmins**         | DNS service DLL injection → SYSTEM shell on DC.            |
| **Print Operators**   | SpoolSample / PrintNightmare (RCE via print spooler).      |
| **Backup Operators**  | Access SAM/NTDS.dit → dump hashes.                         |
| **Server Operators**  | Access to restart services or schedule tasks on DCs.       |
## 4. Group Membership Abuse

You can escalate privileges by:

- **Adding your user** to one of these groups.    
- **Impersonating a member** (via token impersonation or Kerberos).
- **Abusing delegation paths** (see BloodHound).
## 5. Tools for Enumeration and Abuse

- `PowerView`    
- `SharpHound` (BloodHound)
- `net group`, `net localgroup`
- `Get-ADGroupMember`
- `mimikatz` (token manipulation)
## 6. BloodHound Mapping

BloodHound helps visualize **group membership relationships**, indirect paths to Domain Admin, and **abuse permissions** like:

- `GenericWrite`    
- `AddMember`
- `ForceChangePassword`
## 7. Post-Exploitation Questions to Ask

- Am I a member of any privileged group?
- Can I add myself to one?
- Can I impersonate someone who is?
- Can I perform ACL abuse on any group object?
