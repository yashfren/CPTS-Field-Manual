# Net Commands

The `net` command suite is a built-in Windows utility used for network configuration and administration tasks. As attackers, these commands are extremely useful for **enumerating users, groups, shares, and sessions** on both local and remote hosts—especially during post-exploitation or privilege escalation.
## 1. User & Group Enumeration

```cmd
net user
```

> Lists all local users.

```cmd
net user <username>
```

> Shows detailed info about a specific user (last set password, groups, logon script, etc.).

```cmd
net localgroup
```

> Lists all local groups.

```cmd
net localgroup administrators
```

> Shows who belongs to the Administrators group.
## 2. Enumerate Shares

```cmd
net share
```

> Displays all shared folders and their paths on the local machine.

```cmd
net view \\<target-ip>
```

> Lists available shares on a remote host (requires proper permissions).
## 3. Enumerate Logged-in Sessions

```cmd
net session
```

> Lists active SMB sessions on the system. Useful for identifying active users and possible lateral movement targets.

```cmd
net statistics workstation
net statistics server
```

> Shows uptime and last boot time. Can be used to infer system activity and session freshness.
## 4. Domain Enumeration (If Domain-Joined)

```cmd
net group /domain
```

> List all domain-level groups.

```cmd
net group "Domain Admins" /domain
```

> List members of the `Domain Admins` group.

```cmd
net user /domain
```

> Enumerate domain users (often rate-limited or blocked by GPOs).
## 5. Trust Relationships (if on a domain)

```cmd
nltest /domain_trusts
```

> View domain trusts—useful for lateral movement between domains.
## 6. Useful Tips

- `net use` – Lists mapped drives or lets you map a remote share:
   
```cmd
net use Z: \\target\share
```

- Many `net` commands will fail silently if you lack permission — always test with low-priv accounts.    
- Use `net view /domain` to discover accessible hosts in the same network segment (useful on flat networks).
