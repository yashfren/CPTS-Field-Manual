### Introduction to Hashcat

Hashcat is a powerful password cracking tool that supports GPU acceleration and can run on Linux, Windows, and macOS. It supports a wide variety of hash types and several attack modes to optimize cracking strategies.
### Basic Syntax

```bash
hashcat -a <attack_mode> -m <hash_mode> <hashes> [wordlist|mask|rule]
```

- `-a` → Attack mode (e.g., 0 for dictionary, 3 for mask)
- `-m` → Hash mode (e.g., 0 for MD5, 100 for SHA1)
- `<hashes>` → A hash string or a file containing hashes
### Hash Modes

Hashcat uses numeric IDs to identify supported hash algorithms:

Examples:

- `0` → MD5    
- `100` → SHA1
- `1400` → SHA256
- `500` → MD5 Crypt

Use:

```bash
hashcat --help
```

Or use HashID to identify hash type:

```bash
hashid -m '<hash>'
```
### Dictionary Attack (`-a 0`)

Crack hashes using a wordlist:

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 <hash> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

Add rules to modify guesses:

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 <hash> rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

Rules directory:

```bash
ls /usr/share/hashcat/rules
```
### Mask Attack (`-a 3`)

Define a pattern for brute-force:

Built-in charsets:

- `?l` → lowercase letters
- `?u` → uppercase letters
- `?d` → digits
- `?s` → special characters
- `?a` → all printable ASCII chars

Example:

```bash
hashcat -a 3 -m 0 <hash> ?u?l?l?l?l?d?s
```

(Starts with 1 uppercase, followed by 4 lowercase, 1 digit, 1 special char)

Custom charsets:

```bash
hashcat -a 3 -m 0 -1 ?l?d <hash> ?1?1?1?1
```
### Output Summary

Hashcat output includes:

- Status (`Cracked`, `Exhausted`, etc.)    
- Hash and mode info
- Speed and progress stats
- Candidate passwords tried
### Notes

- Cracking speed varies based on GPU and wordlist/rule complexity    
- Use optimized masks and rules to reduce keyspace
- Combine dictionary + rules for better efficiency in real-world scenarios

Hashcat is a go-to tool for password recovery and testing password strengths. Mastering its modes and customization options gives fine-grained control over cracking strategies.
