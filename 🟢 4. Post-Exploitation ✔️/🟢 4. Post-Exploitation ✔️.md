# Modules covered

Parts of shells and payloads and file transfers
Linux Privilege Escalation
Windows Privilege Escalation
# Why am I here?
## Because I am in. I probably have a foothold and now I either need to move laterally, as in get creds of some other user with more privileges to root, or find ways to get root with current user.

# What should I do?
## [[🟣 1. Fully Interactive TTY ✔️]]

First thing to do is to upgrade the shell's capabilities. Works on unix based systems.
## [[🟣 2. Linux  Post Exploitation]]

When on Linux targets you may find hidden hosts and services, pillage for credentials and escalate privileges.
## [[🟣 3. Windows Post Exploitation]]

Same as linux targets
## [[🟣 4. Tools]]

Useful tools for post exploitation are covered in this section
#### In short we prepare for [[🟢 5. Lateral Movement]] and do [[🟢 1. Information Gathering ✔️]]
# Goals:

- [ ] Upgrade shell
- [ ] Dump creds / tokens
- [ ] Check priv esc vectors
- [ ] Enumerate internal infra
- [ ] Transfer files/tools
