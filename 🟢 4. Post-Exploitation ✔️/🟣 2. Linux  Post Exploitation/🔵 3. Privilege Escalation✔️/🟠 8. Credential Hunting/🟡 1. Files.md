### Technique Name:

Credential Hunting via Files
### Summary:

Files are one of the richest sources of plaintext or poorly protected credentials in Linux systems. Developers, sysadmins, or automated systems often store hardcoded secrets in configuration files, backup dumps, notes, and even scripts. Exploring such files post-exploitation can reveal passwords, usernames, API tokens, and database credentials.
### Conditions:

- You have access to user or root-level file system.    
- Sufficient read permissions to scan user home directories, `/etc`, `/var`, `/opt`, and other common locations.
### Enumeration:
#### 1. Identify Interesting Files by Extension

Common extensions that may contain sensitive data:

```bash
for ext in ".conf" ".config" ".cnf"; do
  echo "Searching for $ext files:"
  find / -type f -name "*$ext" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core"
done
```
#### 2. Look for Hardcoded Credentials Inside Configs

Grepping for keywords like `user`, `password`, `pass`, `login`:

```bash
for file in $(find / -name "*.conf" -o -name "*.cnf" 2>/dev/null); do
  echo "Inspecting $file:"
  grep -Ei 'user|password|login|passwd' "$file" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "#"
done
```
#### 3. Search for Databases

```bash
for ext in ".sql" ".db" ".*db" ".db*"; do
  echo "Searching for $ext files:"
  find / -name "*$ext" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share\|man"
done
```
#### 4. Find Note Files & Loose Plaintext

```bash
find /home/* -type f \( -name "*.txt" -o ! -name "*.*" \) 2>/dev/null
```
#### 5. Script Files with Embedded Secrets

Useful for spotting passwords hardcoded into code:

```bash
for ext in ".sh" ".py" ".pl" ".jar" ".go" ".c"; do
  echo "Searching for $ext files:"
  find / -name "*$ext" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share"
done
```
#### 6. Cronjobs

May contain executable scripts or secrets in scheduled jobs:

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
ls -la /etc/cron.*
```
#### 7. SSH Keys

Check for presence of SSH private/public key pairs:

```bash
grep -rnw "PRIVATE KEY" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
grep -rnw "ssh-rsa" /home/* 2>/dev/null | grep ":1"
```
### Exploitation:

- Extract plaintext secrets directly if visible.
- Use database or backup files to extract password hashes or contents.
- Use discovered private SSH keys to authenticate across systems.
### Post-Exploitation:

- Try SSH, sudo, database login, or internal app access using the credentials.    
- Dump the credentials in your loot folder.
- Attempt lateral movement if credentials belong to privileged users.
