# Field Manual Entry
## 1. Technique Name:

Initial Enumeration for Linux Privilege Escalation
## 2. Summary:

Before attempting privilege escalation on a compromised Linux host, manual enumeration is critical. It helps identify misconfigurations, weak permissions, sensitive files, and outdated software that can be leveraged to escalate privileges from a low-privileged shell to root. This foundational step informs your attack path and reduces noise during exploitation.
## 3. Conditions / Requirements:

- Initial access to a low-privileged shell on a Linux host    
- Interactive terminal (preferred) or reverse shell
- Common Linux CLI utilities available (e.g., `ps`, `cat`, `find`, `lsblk`, `sudo`)
- Optional tools for automation (e.g., LinEnum, LinPEAS)
## 4. Enumeration Steps:

### A. System Info:

- OS Version:
   
```bash
cat /etc/os-release
uname -a
```
   
→ Look for known exploits related to OS and kernel version.
   
- Kernel Version:
   
```bash
uname -r
```
   
 → Public exploits may target specific vulnerable kernel builds.
### B. Running Processes and Services:

- Processes owned by root:
   
```bash
ps aux | grep root
```

- All current processes (for user activity):
   
```bash
ps au
```
### C. Installed Packages:

- Enumerate versions of packages and binaries:

```bash
dpkg -l
rpm -qa
```
### D. Logged-In Users:

- Identify users and potential for lateral movement:
   
```bash
who
w
users
```
### E. User Home Directories & Artifacts:

- List users:
   
```bash
ls /home
```
 
- Inspect specific directories:

```bash
ls -la /home/<username>/
```
   
- SSH Keys:
   
```bash
ls -l ~/.ssh
```
 
- Bash History:
   
```bash
history
cat /home/<username>/.bash_history
```
### F. Sudo Privileges:

- Check allowed commands:

```bash
sudo -l
```
### G. Configuration Files and Secrets:

- Grep for passwords in config files:

```bash
find / -name "*.conf" -exec grep -i 'pass\|user' {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
### H. /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow Checks:

- Check for password hashes:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/shadow  # if readable
```
### I. Cron Jobs:

- Daily cron jobs:

```bash
ls -la /etc/cron.daily/
```
### J. Disks and Filesystems:

- List block devices and mounted volumes:

```bash
lsblk
df -h
```
### K. SUID/SGID Files:

- (Deferred to its own module later)

### L. Writable Directories and Files:

- Writable directories:

```bash
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type d -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```
   
- Writable files:

```bash
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```
## 5. Exploitation Steps:

None yet—this phase focuses purely on information gathering to inform exploitation paths such as:

- Sudo misconfigurations
- Writable cron jobs/scripts
- Kernel exploits
- Credentials reuse
- SSH key pivoting
- Abusing readable shadow file, etc.
## 6. Post-Exploitation Tips:

- Save enumeration results locally for reference during the engagement.
- Avoid breaking system stability during exploitation of services/kernel.
- If SSH keys are found and reused, consider persistence via `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.    
## 7. Example / Notes:

- If `/etc/passwd` contains a password hash (`sysadm:$6$...`), crack offline using `john` or `hashcat`.
- Writable file found: `/etc/cron.daily/backup`  
    → Inject command to escalate privileges when cron job executes.    
- SSH key at `/home/mrb3n/.ssh/id_rsa`  
    → Check if reused across the internal network using ARP or `netstat`.
