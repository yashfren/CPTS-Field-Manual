### 1. Technique Name:

Accessing and Mounting BitLocker-Encrypted Volumes on Linux
### Summary:

BitLocker is a full-volume encryption feature by Microsoft. On compromised dual-boot systems or external drives protected with BitLocker, post-exploitation often involves mounting the encrypted volume to access its contents. On Linux, this can be achieved using `dislocker`, a tool that allows decryption and access to BitLocker volumes.
### Conditions:

- A BitLocker-encrypted volume is detected (typically NTFS format with a recovery key or password).
- `dislocker` and `ntfs-3g` must be installed on the Linux host or attackerâ€™s mounted environment.    
- You must have a valid recovery password, BEK file, or cleartext password to unlock the volume.
### 2. Enumeration:

#### Identify BitLocker Volumes:

```bash
lsblk
fdisk -l
blkid
```

Look for NTFS partitions (often `/dev/sdXn`) that are not yet mounted.
### 3. Exploitation (Mounting Steps):
#### 1. Install `dislocker` if not already present:

```bash
sudo apt install dislocker
```
#### 2. Create mount points:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/bitlocker
mkdir /mnt/bitmount
```
#### 3. Unlock the volume:

- Using recovery password:

```bash
dislocker -V /dev/sdXn -u -- /mnt/bitlocker
```

- Using recovery key (48-digit key):

```bash
dislocker -V /dev/sdXn -r -k /path/to/recovery.key -- /mnt/bitlocker
```

This creates a file `/mnt/bitlocker/dislocker-file`, which contains the decrypted volume.
#### 4. Mount the decrypted volume:

```bash
mount -o loop /mnt/bitlocker/dislocker-file /mnt/bitmount
```
### 4. Post-Exploitation:

- Navigate to `/mnt/bitmount` to access decrypted files.
- Search for credentials, documents, or browser history.
- Use tools like `grep`, `strings`, or forensic software for parsing Windows data.
### Example:

```bash
lsblk
# Find target at /dev/sdb2

dislocker -V /dev/sdb2 -u -- /mnt/bitlocker
mount -o loop /mnt/bitlocker/dislocker-file /mnt/bitmount
ls /mnt/bitmount/Users/
```

You now have full read access to the Windows partition.
