### 1. Technique Name:

Information Gathering (Post-Exploitation)
### Summary:

This stage involves collecting detailed information from the compromised Linux host after initial access. The objective is to enumerate sensitive files, system architecture, mounted devices, user accounts, and other system internals that may aid in lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.
### Conditions:

- Access to a shell on the target Linux machine (low-privileged or root).    
- No prior destructive actions taken on the machine.
- Common Linux utilities (e.g., `cat`, `ls`, `grep`, `mount`) are available.
### 2. Enumeration:
#### 1. Basic System Information

```bash
uname -a
cat /etc/os-release
hostnamectl
```
#### 2. Users and Groups

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1
cat /etc/group | cut -d: -f1
```
#### 3. Current User Context

```bash
id
whoami
```
#### 4. User Activity and Sessions

```bash
w
who
last -a
```
#### 5. Check for Virtualization

```bash
systemd-detect-virt
lscpu | grep -i hypervisor
```
#### 6. Kernel and Packages

```bash
uname -r
dpkg -l      # Debian-based
rpm -qa      # RedHat-based
```
#### 7. Network Configuration

```bash
ip a
ip r
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
#### 8. Mounted Volumes

```bash
mount
lsblk
df -hT
```
#### 9. Running Processes

```bash
ps aux
top -n 1
```
### 3. Exploitation:

This step is passive and not directly exploitable. However, the collected info supports:

- Tailoring privilege escalation
- Building a persistence strategy
- Finding sensitive mount points (e.g., BitLocker, NFS, encrypted partitions)
### 4. Post-Exploitation:

- Save all output locally for analysis
- Use gathered data to guide privilege escalation techniques
- Correlate user activity with access to sensitive resources
### Example:

```bash
uname -a
# Output: Linux NIX02 5.10.0-19-amd64 ...

cat /etc/passwd | grep bash
# Output: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```
