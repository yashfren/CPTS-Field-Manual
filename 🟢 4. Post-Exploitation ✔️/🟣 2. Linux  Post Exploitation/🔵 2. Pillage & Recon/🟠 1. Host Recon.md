### 1.  Technique Name:

Reconnaissance of Host Environment Post-Exploitation
### Summary:

Once a foothold is gained on a Linux system, host-level reconnaissance helps understand the system's role, network configuration, installed services, users, and more. This information is essential for further lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.
### Conditions:

- You have at least low-privileged shell access to a Linux machine.
- Most commands used here require no elevated privileges.    
### 2. Enumeration:
#### System Info:

```bash
uname -a
cat /etc/*-release
hostnamectl
```
#### Who Are We?

```bash
whoami
id
groups
```
#### Hostname, Domain & Network Identity:

```bash
hostname
dnsdomainname
```
#### Current Users Logged In:

```bash
w
who
```
#### Environment Variables:

```bash
printenv
env
```
#### Users with Shell Access:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep '/bin/bash'
```
#### List of All Users:

```bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
```
#### Last Logins:

```bash
last -a
```
#### Current TTY Sessions:

```bash
who -a
```
#### Local Listening Ports:

```bash
ss -tuln
netstat -tuln
```
#### Active Network Connections:

```bash
ss -tunap
```
#### Mounted Devices and Filesystems:

```bash
mount
df -h
```
#### Systemd Services (running/enabled):

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled
```
#### Installed Packages:

```bash
dpkg -l             # Debian-based
rpm -qa             # RHEL-based
```
#### Scheduled Cron Jobs:

```bash
crontab -l
ls -la /etc/cron.*
```
#### Shell History for All Users (if accessible):

```bash
ls -la /home/*/.bash_history
```
#### Network Interfaces:

```bash
ip a
```
#### Routing Table:

```bash
ip r
```
#### DNS Resolvers:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
### 3. Post-Exploitation:

- Identify high-value targets like SSH keys, configuration files, local databases.    
- Look for misconfigured services, insecure cron jobs, or readable scripts run by privileged users.
- Map reachable systems and identify possible lateral movement vectors.
