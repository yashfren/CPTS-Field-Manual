# Intro

XXE, or XML External Entity Injection, is a class of input-based vulnerabilities that arise when an XML parser processes external entities defined within XML documents. These entities can reference local files, remote resources, or even be used to execute commands or perform denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability is rooted in how XML parsers resolve custom or external entity definitions, often without appropriate security configurations.

This vulnerability is most commonly encountered in web applications that accept XML input from usersâ€”such as through file uploads, SOAP APIs, or contact forms. If the XML parser is improperly configured, attackers can define their own DTDs (Document Type Definitions) and embed malicious entities to access sensitive backend resources.

To find XXE vulnerabilities, testers typically look for any input that accepts or is converted into XML before reaching the server. This includes checking request content types (`application/xml`, `text/xml`), examining APIs, and identifying places where user-supplied XML is processed. Tools like Burp Suite or manual interception with modified XML payloads are used to test entity resolution. The presence of response reflection (e.g., `<email>your-input</email>`) helps confirm injection points. If response-based output is not available, error messages or blind out-of-band exfiltration techniques can be used instead.

Exploitation involves injecting a `<!DOCTYPE>` block containing a malicious entity, referencing local files or remote endpoints, and observing how the server resolves those entities. This can lead to file disclosure, remote code execution, or SSRF depending on the parserâ€™s capabilities. While the scope and impact vary, XXE is categorized as a critical vulnerability because it breaks the trust boundary between user input and system-level resource access.
