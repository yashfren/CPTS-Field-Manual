# Intro
###  Overview

- File uploads are a common feature in modern web apps (e.g., profile images, documents).    
- If not securely implemented, they allow attackers to upload **malicious files**.
### Risk

- Insecure file uploads are **high/critical** CVEs.
- May lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** if a web shell or reverse shell is uploaded.
### Attack Scenarios

- **Arbitrary file upload**: Upload any file type (e.g., `.php`) without authentication.    
- **Limited upload attacks** (only specific file types allowed):
    - Stored XSS via HTML, SVG
    - XXE via XML-based files        
    - DoS using large files or decompression bombs
### Root Cause

- Poor file **validation** or **missing checks** (extension, MIME type, content).
- Use of **outdated libraries** can also be a source of vulnerabilities.
