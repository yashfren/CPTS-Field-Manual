# Enumerating Trust Relationships
###### We can use the Get-ADTrust cmdlet to enumerate domain trust relationships. This is especially helpful if we are limited to just using built-in tools.
## Using Get-ADTrust

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module activedirectory
PS C:\htb> Get-ADTrust -Filter *

Direction               : BiDirectional
DisallowTransivity      : False

ForestTransitive        : True
IntraForest             : False
IsTreeParent            : False
IsTreeRoot              : False

TGTDelegation           : False
TrustAttributes         : 8
TrustedPolicy           :
TrustingPolicy          :
TrustType               : Uplevel
UplevelOnly             : False

```
###### The above output shows that our current domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL has two domain trusts. The first is with LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL, and the IntraForest property shows that this is a child domain, and we are currently positioned in the root domain of the forest. The second trust is with the domain FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL, and the ForestTransitive property is set to True, which means that this is a forest trust or external trust. We can see that both trusts are set up to be bidirectional, meaning that users can authenticate back and forth across both trusts. This is important to note down during an assessment. If we cannot authenticate across a trust, we cannot perform any enumeration or attacks across the trust.
###### Aside from using built-in AD tools such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, both PowerView and BloodHound can be utilized to enumerate trust relationships, the type of trusts established, and the authentication flow. After importing PowerView, we can use the Get-DomainTrust function to enumerate what trusts exist, if any.

Checking for Existing Trusts using Get-DomainTrust

```PowerShell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrust 

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 8:07:09 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/27/2022 12:02:39 AM
```
###### PowerView can be used to perform a domain trust mapping and provide information such as the type of trust (parent/child, external, forest) and the direction of the trust (one-way or bidirectional). This information is beneficial once a foothold is obtained, and we plan to compromise the environment further.
### Using Get-DomainTrustMapping

```PowerShell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrustMapping

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 8:07:09 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/27/2022 12:02:39 AM

SourceName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TargetName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 8:07:08 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/27/2022 12:02:41 AM

SourceName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM
```
###### From here, we could begin performing enumeration across the trusts. For example, we could look at all users in the child domain:
### Checking Users in the Child Domain using Get-DomainUser

```Powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Domain LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL | select SamAccountName

samaccountname
--------------
htb-student_adm
Administrator
Guest
lab_adm
krbtgt
```
###### Another tool we can use to get Domain Trust is netdom. The netdom query sub-command of the netdom command-line tool in Windows can retrieve information about the domain, including a list of workstations, servers, and domain trusts.
### Using netdom to query domain trust

```cmdshell
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local trust
Direction Trusted\Trusting domain                         Trust type
========= =======================                         ==========

<->       LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Direct
 Not found

<->       FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
Direct
 Not found

The command completed successfully.
```
### Using netdom to query domain controllers

```cmdshell
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local dc
List of domain controllers with accounts in the domain:

ACADEMY-EA-DC01

The command completed successfully.
```
### Using netdom to query workstations and servers

```cmdshell
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local workstation
List of workstations with accounts in the domain:

ACADEMY-EA-MS01
ACADEMY-EA-MX01      ( Workstation or Server )

SQL01      ( Workstation or Server )
ILF-XRG      ( Workstation or Server )
MAINLON      ( Workstation or Server )
CISERVER      ( Workstation or Server )
INDEX-DEV-LON      ( Workstation or Server )
...SNIP...
```

We can also use BloodHound to visualize these trust relationships by using the Map Domain Trusts pre-built query. Here we can easily see that two bidirectional trusts exist.
