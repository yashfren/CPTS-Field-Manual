### Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts
###### The SYSVOL share can be a treasure trove of data, especially in large organizations. We may find many different batch, VBScript, and PowerShell scripts within the scripts directory, which is readable by all authenticated users in the domain. It is worth digging around this directory to hunt for passwords stored in scripts. Sometimes we will find very old scripts containing since disabled accounts or old passwords, but from time to time, we will strike gold, so we should always dig through this directory. Here, we can see an interesting script named reset_local_admin_pass.vbs.
### Discovering an Interesting Script

```powershell
PS C:\htb> ls \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

    Directory: \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                 
----                -------------         ------ ----

```

Taking a closer look at the script, we see that it contains a password for the built-in local administrator on Windows hosts. In this case, it would be worth checking to see if this password is still set on any hosts in the domain. We could do this using CrackMapExec and the --local-auth flag as shown in this module's Internal Password Spraying - from Linux section.
### Finding a Password in the Script

```powershell
PS C:\htb> cat \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts\reset_local_admin_pass.vbs

On Error Resume Next
strComputer = "."
 
Set oShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") 
sUser = "Administrator"
sPwd = "!ILFREIGHT_L0cALADmin!"
 
Set Arg = WScript.Arguments
If  Arg.Count > 0 Then
sPwd = Arg(0) 'Pass the password as parameter to the script
End if
 
'Get the administrator name
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")

<SNIP>
```
