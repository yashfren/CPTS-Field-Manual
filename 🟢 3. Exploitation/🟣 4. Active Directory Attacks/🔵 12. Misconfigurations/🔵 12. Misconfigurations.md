### Exchange Related Group Membership
###### A default installation of Microsoft Exchange within an AD environment (with no split-administration model) opens up many attack vectors, as Exchange is often granted considerable privileges within the domain (via users, groups, and ACLs). The group Exchange Windows Permissions is not listed as a protected group, but members are granted the ability to write a DACL to the domain object. This can be leveraged to give a user DCSync privileges. An attacker can add accounts to this group by leveraging a DACL misconfiguration (possible) or by leveraging a compromised account that is a member of the Account Operators group. It is common to find user accounts and even computers as members of this group. Power users and support staff in remote offices are often added to this group, allowing them to reset passwords. This GitHub repo details a few techniques for leveraging Exchange for escalating privileges in an AD environment.
###### The Exchange group Organization Management is another extremely powerful group (effectively the "Domain Admins" of Exchange) and can access the mailboxes of all domain users. It is not uncommon for sysadmins to be members of this group. This group also has full control of the OU called Microsoft Exchange Security Groups, which contains the group Exchange Windows Permissions.
### Viewing Organization Management's Permissions
###### Advanced Security Settings for Organization Management showing permissions for Exchange Trusted Subsystem.
###### If we can compromise an Exchange server, this will often lead to Domain Admin privileges. Additionally, dumping credentials in memory from an Exchange server will produce 10s if not 100s of cleartext credentials or NTLM hashes. This is often due to users logging in to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange caching their credentials in memory after a successful login.
### PrivExchange
###### The PrivExchange attack results from a flaw in the Exchange Server PushSubscription feature, which allows any domain user with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over HTTP.
###### The Exchange service runs as SYSTEM and is over-privileged by default (i.e., has WriteDacl privileges on the domain pre-2019 Cumulative Update). This flaw can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and dump the domain NTDS database. If we cannot relay to LDAP, this can be leveraged to relay and authenticate to other hosts within the domain. This attack will take you directly to Domain Admin with any authenticated domain user account.
### Printer Bug
###### The Printer Bug is a flaw in the MS-RPRN protocol (Print System Remote Protocol). This protocol defines the communication of print job processing and print system management between a client and a print server. To leverage this flaw, any domain user can connect to the spool's named pipe with the RpcOpenPrinter method and use the RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx method, and force the server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over SMB.
###### The spooler service runs as SYSTEM and is installed by default in Windows servers running Desktop Experience. This attack can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and grant your attacker account DCSync privileges to retrieve all password hashes from AD.
###### The attack can also be used to relay LDAP authentication and grant Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) privileges for the victim to a computer account under our control, thus giving the attacker privileges to authenticate as any user on the victim's computer. This attack can be leveraged to compromise a Domain Controller in a partner domain/forest, provided you have administrative access to a Domain Controller in the first forest/domain already, and the trust allows TGT delegation, which is not by default anymore.
###### We can use tools such as the Get-SpoolStatus module from this tool (that can be found on the spawned target) or this tool to check for machines vulnerable to the MS-PRN Printer Bug. This flaw can be used to compromise a host in another forest that has Unconstrained Delegation enabled, such as a domain controller. It can help us to attack across forest trusts once we have compromised one forest.
### Enumerating for MS-PRN Printer Bug

```Powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\SecurityAssessment.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

ComputerName                        Status
------------                        ------
ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   True
MS14-068
```
### Sniffing LDAP Credentials
###### Many applications and printers store LDAP credentials in their web admin console to connect to the domain. These consoles are often left with weak or default passwords. Sometimes, these credentials can be viewed in cleartext. Other times, the application has a test connection function that we can use to gather credentials by changing the LDAP IP address to that of our attack host and setting up a netcat listener on LDAP port 389. When the device attempts to test the LDAP connection, it will send the credentials to our machine, often in cleartext. Accounts used for LDAP connections are often privileged, but if not, this could serve as an initial foothold in the domain. Other times, a full LDAP server is required to pull off this attack, as detailed in this post.
### Enumerating DNS Records
###### We can use a tool such as adidnsdump to enumerate all DNS records in a domain using a valid domain user account. This is especially helpful if the naming convention for hosts returned to us in our enumeration using tools such as BloodHound is similar to SRV01934.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. If all servers and workstations have a non-descriptive name, it makes it difficult for us to know what exactly to attack. If we can access DNS entries in AD, we can potentially discover interesting DNS records that point to this same server, such as JENKINS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL, which we can use to better plan out our attacks.
###### The tool works because, by default, all users can list the child objects of a DNS zone in an AD environment. By default, querying DNS records using LDAP does not return all results. So by using the adidnsdump tool, we can resolve all records in the zone and potentially find something useful for our engagement. The background and more in-depth explanation of this tool and technique can be found in this post.
###### On the first run of the tool, we can see that some records are blank, namely ?,LOGISTICS,?.
### Using adidnsdump

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5

?,LOGISTICS,?
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::7442:c49d:e1d7:2691

AAAA,DomainDnsZones,dead:beef::231
A,DomainDnsZones,10.129.202.29
```
###### If we run again with the -r flag the tool will attempt to resolve unknown records by performing an A query. Now we can see that an IP address of 172.16.5.240 showed up for LOGISTICS. While this is a small example, it is worth running this tool in larger environments. We may uncover "hidden" records that can lead to discovering interesting hosts.
### Using the -r Option to Resolve Unknown Records

```
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r
