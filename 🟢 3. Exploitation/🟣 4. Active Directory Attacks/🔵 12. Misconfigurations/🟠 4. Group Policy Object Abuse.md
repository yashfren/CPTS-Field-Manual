## Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse
###### Group Policy provides administrators with many advanced settings that can be applied to both user and computer objects in an AD environment. Group Policy, when used right, is an excellent tool for hardening an AD environment by configuring user settings, operating systems, and applications. That being said, Group Policy can also be abused by attackers. If we can gain rights over a Group Policy Object via an ACL misconfiguration, we could leverage this for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and even domain compromise and as a persistence mechanism within the domain. Understanding how to enumerate and attack GPOs can give us a leg up and can sometimes be the ticket to achieving our goal in a rather locked-down environment.
##### GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:
- ###### Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
- ###### Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
- ###### Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions
- ###### We can enumerate GPO information using many of the tools we've been using throughout this module such as PowerView and BloodHound. We can also use - group3r, ADRecon, PingCastle, among others, to audit the security of GPOs in a domain.

## Using the Get-DomainGPO function from PowerView, we can get a listing of GPOs by name.
### Enumerating GPO Names with PowerView

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO |select displayname

displayname
-----------
Default Domain Policy
Default Domain Controllers Policy
Deny Control Panel Access
Disallow LM Hash
Deny CMD Access
Disable Forced Restarts
Block Removable Media
Disable Guest Account
Service Accounts Password Policy
Logon Banner
Disconnect Idle RDP
Disable NetBIOS
AutoLogon
GuardAutoLogon
Certificate Services
```
### Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName

DisplayName
-----------
Certificate Services
Default Domain Policy
Disable NetBIOS
Disable Guest Account
AutoLogon
Default Domain Controllers Policy
Disconnect Idle RDP
Disallow LM Hash
Deny CMD Access
Block Removable Media
GuardAutoLogon
Service Accounts Password Policy
Logon Banner
Disable Forced Restarts
Deny Control Panel Access
```
### Enumerating Domain User GPO Rights

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

ObjectDN              : CN={7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ObjectSID             :
ActiveDirectoryRights : CreateChild, DeleteChild, ReadProperty, WriteProperty, Delete, GenericExecute, WriteDacl,
                        WriteOwner
BinaryLength          : 36
AceQualifier          : AccessAllowed
IsCallback            : False
OpaqueLength          : 0
AccessMask            : 983095
SecurityIdentifier    : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-513
AceType               : AccessAllowed
AceFlags              : ObjectInherit, ContainerInherit
IsInherited           : False
InheritanceFlags      : ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit
PropagationFlags      : None
AuditFlags            : None
```
###### Here we can see that the Domain Users group has various permissions over a GPO, such as WriteProperty and WriteDacl, which we could leverage to give ourselves full control over the GPO and pull off any number of attacks that would be pushed down to any users and computers in OUs that the GPO is applied to. We can use the GPO GUID combined with Get-GPO to see the display name of the GPO.
### Converting GPO GUID to Name

```powershell
PS C:\htb Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532

DisplayName      : Disconnect Idle RDP
DomainName       : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Owner            : INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
Id               : 7ca9c789-14ce-46e3-a722-83f4097af532
GpoStatus        : AllSettingsEnabled
Description      :
