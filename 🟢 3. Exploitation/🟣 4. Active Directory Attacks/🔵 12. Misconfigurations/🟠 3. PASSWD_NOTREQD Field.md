## PASSWD_NOTREQD Field - Passwords maybe weak or blank

It is possible to come across domain accounts with the passwd_notreqd field set in the userAccountControl attribute. If this is set, the user is not subject to the current password policy length, meaning they could have a shorter password or no password at all (if empty passwords are allowed in the domain). A password may be set as blank intentionally (sometimes admins donâ€™t want to be called out of hours to reset user passwords) or accidentally hitting enter before entering a password when changing it via the command line. Just because this flag is set on an account, it doesn't mean that no password is set, just that one may not be required. There are many reasons why this flag may be set on a user account, one being that a vendor product set this flag on certain accounts at the time of installation and never removed the flag post-install. It is worth enumerating accounts with this flag set and testing each to see if no password is required (I have seen this a couple of times on assessments). Also, include it in the client report if the goal of the assessment is to be as comprehensive as possible.
