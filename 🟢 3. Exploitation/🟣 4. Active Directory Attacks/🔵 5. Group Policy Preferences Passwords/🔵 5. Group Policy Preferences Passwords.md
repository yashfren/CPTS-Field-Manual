### Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords
###### When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to Map drives (drives.xml), Create local users, Create printer config files (printers.xml), Creating and updating services (services.xml), Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml), Changing local admin passwords.
###### These files can contain an array of configuration data and defined passwords. The cpassword attribute value is AES-256 bit encrypted, but Microsoft published the AES private key on MSDN, which can be used to decrypt the password. Any domain user can read these files as they are stored on the SYSVOL share, and all authenticated users in a domain, by default, have read access to this domain controller share.
###### This was patched in 2014 MS14-025 Vulnerability in GPP could allow elevation of privilege, to prevent administrators from setting passwords using GPP. The patch does not remove existing Groups.xml files with passwords from SYSVOL. If you delete the GPP policy instead of unlinking it from the OU, the cached copy on the local computer remains.
###### If you retrieve the cpassword value more manually, the gpp-decrypt utility can be used to decrypt the password as follows:
### Decrypting the Password with gpp-decrypt

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE

Password1
```
###### GPP passwords can be located by searching or manually browsing the SYSVOL share or using tools such as Get-GPPPassword.ps1, the GPP Metasploit Post Module, and other Python/Ruby scripts which will locate the GPP and return the decrypted cpassword value. CrackMapExec also has two modules for locating and retrieving GPP passwords. One quick tip to consider during engagements: Often, GPP passwords are defined for legacy accounts, and you may therefore retrieve and decrypt the password for a locked or deleted account. However, it is worth attempting to password spray internally with this password (especially if it is unique). Password re-use is widespread, and the GPP password combined with password spraying could result in further access.

### Locating & Retrieving GPP Passwords with CrackMapExec

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp

[*] gpp_autologin             Searches the domain controller for registry.xml to find autologon information and returns the username and password.
[*] gpp_password              Retrieves the plaintext password and other information for accounts pushed through Group Policy Preferences.
```

###### It is also possible to find passwords in files such as Registry.xml when autologon is configured via Group Policy. This may be set up for any number of reasons for a machine to automatically log in at boot. If this is set via Group Policy and not locally on the host, then anyone on the domain can retrieve credentials stored in the Registry.xml file created for this purpose. This is a separate issue from GPP passwords as Microsoft has not taken any action to block storing these credentials on the SYSVOL in cleartext and, hence, are readable by any authenticated user in the domain. We can hunt for this using CrackMapExec with the gpp_autologin module, or using the Get-GPPAutologon.ps1 script included in PowerSploit.
