#### RDP Session Hijacking

As shown in the example below, we are logged in as the user `juurena` (UserID = 2) who has `Administrator` privileges. Our goal is to hijack the user `lewen` (User ID = 4), who is also logged in via RDP.

To successfully impersonate a user without their password, we need to have `SYSTEM` privileges and use the Microsoft [tscon.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tscon) binary that enables users to connect to another desktop session. It works by specifying which `SESSION ID` (`4` for the `lewen` session in our example) we would like to connect to which session name (`rdp-tcp#13`, which is our current session). So, for example, the following command will open a new console as the specified `SESSION_ID` within our current RDP session:

```cmd-session
C:\htb> tscon #{TARGET_SESSION_ID} /dest:#{OUR_SESSION_NAME}
```

If we have local administrator privileges, we can use several methods to obtain `SYSTEM` privileges, such as [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) or [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz). A simple trick is to create a Windows service that, by default, will run as `Local System` and will execute any binary with `SYSTEM` privileges. We will use [Microsoft sc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-create) binary. First, we specify the service name (`sessionhijack`) and the `binpath`, which is the command we want to execute. Once we run the following command, a service named `sessionhijack` will be created.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> query user

 USERNAME              SESSIONNAME        ID  STATE   IDLE TIME  LOGON TIME
>juurena               rdp-tcp#13          1  Active          7  8/25/2021 1:23 AM
 lewen                 rdp-tcp#14          2  Active          *  8/25/2021 1:28 AM

C:\htb> sc.exe create sessionhijack binpath= "cmd.exe /k tscon 2 /dest:rdp-tcp#13"

[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
```

To run the command, we can start the `sessionhijack` service :

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net start sessionhijack
```

Once the service is started, a new terminal with the `lewen` user session will appear. With this new account, we can attempt to discover what kind of privileges it has on the network, and maybe we'll get lucky, and the user is a member of the Help Desk group with admin rights to many hosts or even a Domain Admin.
