# Spawning interactive shells
## /bin/sh -i

This command will execute the shell interpreter specified in the path in interactive mode (`-i`).
#### Interactive

```bash
/bin/sh -i
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-4.2$
```
## Perl

If the programming language [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) is present on the system, these commands will execute the shell interpreter specified.
#### Perl To Shell

```bash
perl —e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```

```bash
perl: exec "/bin/sh";
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.
## Ruby

If the programming language [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is present on the system, this command will execute the shell interpreter specified:
#### Ruby To Shell

```bash
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.
## Lua

If the programming language [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is present on the system, we can use the `os.execute` method to execute the shell interpreter specified using the full command below:
#### Lua To Shell

```bash
lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.
## AWK

[AWK](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/awk.1p.html) is a C-like pattern scanning and processing language present on most UNIX/Linux-based systems, widely used by developers and sysadmins to generate reports. It can also be used to spawn an interactive shell. This is shown in the short awk script below:
#### AWK To Shell

```bash
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
```
## Find

[Find](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) is a command present on most Unix/Linux systems widely used to search for & through files and directories using various criteria. It can also be used to execute applications and invoke a shell interpreter.
#### Using Find For A Shell

```bash
find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
```

This use of the find command is searching for any file listed after the `-name` option, then it executes `awk` (`/bin/awk`) and runs the same script we discussed in the awk section to execute a shell interpreter.
## Using Exec To Launch A Shell

```bash
find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
```

This use of the find command uses the execute option (`-exec`) to initiate the shell interpreter directly. If `find` can't find the specified file, then no shell will be attained.
## VIM

Yes, we can set the shell interpreter language from within the popular command-line-based text-editor `VIM`. This is a very niche situation we would find ourselves in to need to use this method, but it is good to know just in case.
#### Vim To Shell

```bash
vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
```
#### Vim Escape

```bash
vim
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
```
