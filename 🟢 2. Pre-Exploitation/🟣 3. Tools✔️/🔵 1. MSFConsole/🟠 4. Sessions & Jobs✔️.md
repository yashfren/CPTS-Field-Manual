# Sessions:  
Sessions in Metasploit represent active communication channels between the attacker and exploited targets. Each session allows interaction with a compromised system, and multiple sessions can be created, backgrounded, switched between, or used by other modules like post-exploitation tools.
#### Backgrounding a session - ctrl + z: 

```
meterpreter> bg
```

```
meterpreter> background
```
#### Listing Active Sessions

We can use the `sessions` command to view our currently active sessions.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec_psh) > sessions

Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                     Information                 Connection
  --  ----  ----                     -----------                 ----------
  1         meterpreter x86/windows  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM @ MS01  10.10.10.129:443 -> 10.10.10.205:50501 (10.10.10.205)
```
#### Interacting with a Session

You can use the `sessions -i [no.]` command to open up a specific session.

```bash
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec_psh) > sessions -i 1
[*] Starting interaction with 1...
```
# Jobs:  
Jobs are background tasks running inside Metasploit, such as listeners or exploits that stay active. Jobs can be listed, killed, or managed independently of sessions and are useful when running multiple long-running modules or listeners in parallel.
#### Viewing the Jobs Command Help Menu

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > jobs -h
Usage: jobs [options]

Active job manipulation and interaction.

OPTIONS:

    -K        Terminate all running jobs.
    -P        Persist all running jobs on restart.
    -S <opt>  Row search filter.
    -h        Help banner.
    -i <opt>  Lists detailed information about a running job.
    -k <opt>  Terminate jobs by job ID and/or range.
    -l        List all running jobs.
    -p <opt>  Add persistence to job by job ID
    -v        Print more detailed info.  Use with -i and -l
```
#### Viewing the Exploit Command Help Menu

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -h
Usage: exploit [options]

Launches an exploitation attempt.

OPTIONS:

    -J        Force running in the foreground, even if passive.
    -e <opt>  The payload encoder to use.  If none is specified, ENCODER is used.
    -f        Force the exploit to run regardless of the value of MinimumRank.
    -h        Help banner.
    -j        Run in the context of a job.
	
<SNIP
```
#### Running an Exploit as a Background Job

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -j
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.34:4444
```
#### Listing Running Jobs

To list all running jobs, we can use the `jobs -l` command. To kill a specific job, look at the index no. of the job and use the `kill [index no.]` command. Use the `jobs -K` command to kill all running jobs.

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > jobs -l
```

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > kill [index no.]
```

```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > jobs -K
```
