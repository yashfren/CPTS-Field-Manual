| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Auxiliary` | Scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and admin capabilities. Offer extra assistance and functionality.  |
| `Encoders`  | Ensure that payloads are intact to their destination.                                           |
| `Exploits`  | Defined as modules that exploit a vulnerability that will allow for the payload delivery.       |
| `NOPs`      | (No Operation code) Keep the payload sizes consistent across exploit attempts.                  |
| `Payloads`  | Code runs remotely and calls back to the attacker machine to establish a connection (or shell). |
| `Plugins`   | Additional scripts can be integrated within an assessment with `msfconsole` and coexist.        |
| `Post`      | Wide array of modules to gather information, pivot deeper, etc.                                 |
